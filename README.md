# Clap-Counter
A simple Arduino clap counter to execute code based on clap count.

# Usage
First, you'll want to install the RBD_Light library from http://robotsbigdata.com/docs-arduino-light.html.
>After the library is installed, connect the components;
 *	Mic sensor:  OUT>D7    GND>GND   VCC>5V
 * Relay:      VCC>5V    GND>GND   CTRL>8
 * LED1:       POS>3V3   NEG>D12
*	Optional
>Once all that's done, just connect the Arduino to the computer and upload the code!

>Make sure you:
  *	Clap loud
  *	Adjust mic sensitivity
  *	Change code to fit any new additions
  *	Connect parts BEFORE adding power
  *	DOUBLE CHECK CONNECTIONS!
